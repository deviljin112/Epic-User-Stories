# Epic & User Stories

## Agile Epic

An agile epic is a block of work that can be broken down into smaller more specific tasks, these tasks are called "user stories". These tasks are also based on the customer needs.

An agile epic usually involved multiple teams working on multiple projects often tracked by multiple boards.

Epics are delivered over a multiple sprints and as the team discovers need challenges and needs user stories will be added or removed as required.

Key elements of an Agile Epic:

- Flexible Scope
- Based on customer feedback
- Teamwork and communication
- Continous adaptation of user stories

Guidelines for defining an Epic:

- A story that is longer than 8 story points
- A story that cant be completed in one sprint

### Example

A company does a project. This project has to be fullfilled by multiple departments coordinating together. This project would be considered an Epic, as each story is aimed at fullfilling the main Epic. Its important that each team supports each other for an epic to be completed

## User Story

An agile user story is a general explanation of a feature seen from the perspective of the end user. The core idea is that this will feature is aimed at providing value to the client. These are usually the smaller elements that when combined together create an Epic. Each team would have its own set of stories for the global epic.

User stories put the client as the driver of the project, making the development mold and adapt to their requirements and needs. These stories provide user-focused framework for work which drives collaboration, creativity as well as quality of the end product.

Key elements:

- why building the project
- what needs to be built
- what value it creates

### Example 2

Multiple teams are working on a project. The client asks that they want X Y Z functionality in their software as this will allow them to be more efficient (for example). These X Y Z conditions would be considered a story together with the reasoning for why they should be created. As the client is after efficiency the team knows what they need to keep in mind while fullfilling the requirements.

## Scrum

A scrum framework allows teams to create multiple boards for each team. These boards would have a global epic that they would follow. While each team would have their own interpretations of the user stories that they will fullfil to complete an Epic.

Because of the nature of Epic and User Stories, Scum is an essential part of a successful implementation. Scum has an explicit timeboxed interation called Sprints. This therefore allows a team to organise short weekly sprints which can be broken down to user story implementations. Scrum also is helpful at establishing a simple hierachy in a product backlog. This is useful for a good implementation of Epics and focusing each team at task at hand.

## Agile

Epics are not essential for an implementation of agile however, they are a practical driver for most teams. Understading how, why and what is required for a completion of a project creates a much healthier context for a team. It reduces risks and any potential issues that the team may face.
